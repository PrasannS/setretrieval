      "In the field of epidemiology, the causal mechanisms responsible for diseases can be understood using the causal pie model.This conceptual model was introduced by Ken Rothman to communicate how constellations of component causes can lead to a sufficient cause to lead to a condition of interest and that reflection on these sets could improve epidemiological study design. A set of proposed causal mechanisms are represented as pie charts where each pie in the diagram represent a theoretical causal mechanism for a given disease, which is also called a sufficient cause.  Each pie is made up of many component factors, otherwise known as component causes represented by sectors in the diagram. In this framework, each component cause represents an event or condition required for a given disease or outcome. A component cause that appears in every pie is called a necessary cause as the outcome cannot occur without it.\n",

The mainstream view is that the beginnings of trade between the Mediterranean region and South India can be traced back to 500 BCE when the word  (), which was derived from the Proto-South Dravidian *cinki-ver () (for \"ginger\"), first appeared in the Greek language.  This indicates South India possibly having been involved in trade with the Mediterranean diaspora centuries earlier.

His work was critical of the old historiography of Henri Michel and the revisionist school of Robert Paxton. He was critical of the idea of a shared public opinion.

But far more importantly, minicomputers tended to lack any form of high-performance storage; most early designs used punch tape as a primary storage system, and magnetic tape systems were for the high end of the market. In this environment, a system that wrote out the source, compiled it, and then ran the result would have taken minutes. Because of these constraints, interpreters proliferated.\n",

The plot involves ESPer Lady Garra and her Yaksa syndicate launching an attack to remove opposing forces and take over Tokyo. Unlike most Cave shoot 'em ups, the characters only possess a shot attack but players can hold down the fire button to reduce movement. A unique gameplay mechanic is the power gauge, which gives players a force field that acts as a shield. Activating the force field renders the player's character invincible, turning enemy bullets into power-up and gold blocks, until the shield button is released and drains the power gauge. Releasing the shield buttons unleashes a powerful psychic blast capable of obliterating enemies and bullets on-screen.\n",

The local governor at the time, Amir Turki ben Mahdi, allowed the 600 Najrani Jews a single day on which to either evacuate or never leave again. Saudi soldiers accompanied them to the Yemeni border. These Jews arrived in Saada, and some 200 continued south to Aden between September and October 1949. The Saudi King Abdulaziz demanded their return, but the Yemeni king, Ahmad bin Yahya refused, because these refugees were Yemenite Jews. After settling in the Hashid Camp (also called Mahane Geula) they were airlifted to Israel as part of the larger Operation Magic Carpet.\n",

In April 1893 she joined the \"German Peace Society\" (\"Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft \" / DFG), which had been founded at the end of the previous year.   Under the pseudonym \"Berthold Friederici\", and encouraged by Bertha von Suttner, in 1896 she published her little anti-war book, \"Sedansgedanken\" (loosely, \"Thoughts on Sedan\"), referencing the 1871 Battle of Sedan which had cleared the way for German unification.

A further problem for Union and Progress was that the majority of the ethnic Turks of the empire did not see themselves as Turks at all, but rather simply as Sunni Muslims who happened to speak Turkish. The Turkish historian Taner Akçam wrote that at the time of the First World War that \"It is even questionable whether the broad mass of Muslims in Anatolia at the time understood themselves as Turks, or Kurds, rather than as Muslims\". Though the CUP was dedicated to a revolutionary transformation of Ottoman society by its \"science-conscious cadres\", the CUP were conservative revolutionaries who wished to retain the monarchy and Islam's status as the state religion as the Young Turks believed that the sultanate and Islam were an essential part of the glue holding the Ottoman Empire together.\n",

He believes, however, if he tells the story often enough, his crony will eventually receive governmental recognition. Years pass.

Another possibility is that the author of the inscription thought it necessary to repeat these names while describing Samudragupta's later conquests in Aryavarta, simply because these kings belonged to that region.\n",

Regarding the rest, the chamber made the following rulings:\n",
      "Vujadin Popović and Ljubiša Beara - found guilty of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, violations of the laws or customs of war, and crimes against humanity, through their participation in a joint criminal enterprise. The chamber granted their appeal regarding the killing of six Bosnian Muslim men near Trnovo by the Scorpions paramilitary unit, and consequently it reversed their convictions with regard to that killing. It also granted in part the prosecution's appeal to enter convictions for conspiracy to commit genocide against both Popović and Beara, and thus entered a conviction against the two appellants for this crime. Their sentences of life imprisonment were affirmed.\n",
      "Drago Nikolić - his convictions for aiding and abetting genocide, and crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war through his participation in a joint criminal enterprise were upheld. The chamber reversed his convictions for the killing of six Bosnian Muslim men near Trnovo. His sentence of 35 years of imprisonment was affirmed.\n",

The chamber also reversed his convictions for persecution and inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as crimes against humanity in connection with the forcible transfer of the Bosnian Muslim men who crossed the Drina River, fleeing Žepa. It also granted in part his ground of appeal concerning sentencing, recognizing that the trial chamber erred in law by considering his use of authority within the VRS Main Staff as an aggravating circumstance. The chamber also granted the prosecution's ground of appeal regarding \"opportunistic\" killings in Potočari, and entered a conviction against Miletić for murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war for these killings. His sentence of 19 years of imprisonment was reduced to 18 years of imprisonment.\n",

Pandurević was thus found guilty as an aider and abettor or through command responsibility, in relation to various criminal acts, of murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war, extermination as a crime against humanity, and persecution through murder and through cruel and inhumane treatment as a crime against humanity. The chamber entered new convictions for these crimes, and also set aside some of Pandurević's convictions at trial. In dismissing one of Pandurević's challenges regarding aiding and abetting, the chamber recalled that \"specific direction\" is not an element of aiding and abetting under customary international law. His sentence of 13 years of imprisonment was affirmed.\n",

      "Using another genetically engineered mouse that lacks Sgol2 function, and siRNA experiments in oocytes, it has been shown that disruption of the mouse SGOL2 does not cause any alteration in sister chromatid cohesion in embryonic cultured fibroblasts and adult somatic tissues.  Moreover, although these mutant mice also develop normally and survive to adulthood without any apparent alteration, both male and female Sgol2-deficient mice from this line are infertile. By different approaches it was demonstrated that SGOL2 is necessary for protecting centromeric cohesion during mammalian meiosis I. In vivo, the loss of SGOL2 promotes a premature release of the meiosis-specific REC8 cohesin complexes from anaphase I centromeres. This molecular alteration is manifested cytologically by the complete loss of centromere cohesion at metaphase II leading to single chromatids and physiologically with the formation of aneuploid gametes that give rise to infertility.\n",
