      " Title: Superconductivity and other collective phenomena in a hybrid Bose-Fermi mixture formed by a polariton condensate and an electron system in two dimensions Abstract: Interacting Bose-Fermi systems play a central role in condensed matter physics. Here, we analyze a novel Bose-Fermi mixture formed by a cavity exciton-polariton condensate interacting with a two-dimensional electron system. We show that that previous predictions of superconductivity [F.P. Laussy, Phys. Rev. Lett. 10, 104 (2010)] and excitonic supersolid formation [I.A. Shelykh, Phys. Rev. Lett. 14, 105 (2010)] in this system are closely intertwined- resembling the predictions for strongly correlated electron systems such as high temperature superconductors. In stark contrast to a large majority of Bose-Fermi systems analyzed in solids and ultracold atomic gases, the renormalized interaction between the polaritons and electrons in our system is long-ranged and strongly peaked at a tunable wavevector, which can be rendered incommensurate with the Fermi momentum. We analyze the prospects for experimental observation of superconductivity and find that critical temperatures on the order of a few Kelvins can be achieved in heterostructures consisting of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers that are embedded in an open cavity structure. All optical control of superconductivity in semiconductor heterostructures could enable the realization of new device concepts compatible with semiconductor nanotechnology. In addition the possibility to interface quantum Hall physics, superconductivity and nonequilibrium polariton condensates is likely to provide fertile ground for investigation of completely new physical phenomena.\n",

      " Title: The Antimalarial Chloroquine Suppresses LPS-Induced NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and Confers Protection against Murine Endotoxic Shock Abstract: Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which catalyzes maturation of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18, is implicated and essentially involved in many kinds of inflammatory disorders. Chloroquine (CQ) is a traditional antimalarial drug and also possesses an anti-inflammatory property. In this study, we investigated whether CQ suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation and thereby confers protection against murine endotoxic shock. CQ attenuated NF-κB and MAPK activation and prohibited expression of IL-1β, IL-18, and Nlrp3 in LPS treated murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), demonstrating its inhibitory effect on the priming signal of NLRP3 activation. Then, CQ was shown to inhibit caspase-1 activation and ASC specks formation in BMDMs, which indicates that CQ also suppresses inflammasome assembly, the second signal for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In a murine endotoxic shock model, CQ effectively improved survival and markedly reduced IL-1β and IL-18 production in serum, peritoneal fluid, and lung tissues. Moreover, CQ reduced protein levels of NLRP3 and caspases-1 p10 in lung homogenates of mice with endotoxic shock, which may possibly explain its anti-inflammatory activity and life protection efficacy in vivo. Overall, our results demonstrate a new role of CQ that facilitates negative regulation on NLRP3 inflammasome, which thereby confers protection against lethal endotoxic shock.\n",

      " Title: Perturbation theory, effective field theory, and oscillations in the power spectrum Abstract: We explore the relationship between the nonlinear matter power spectrum and the various Lagrangian and Standard Perturbation Theories (LPT and SPT). We first look at it in the context of one dimensional (1-d) dynamics, where 1LPT is exact at the perturbative level and one can exactly resum the SPT series into the 1LPT power spectrum. Shell crossings lead to non-perturbative effects, and the PT ignorance can be quantified in terms of their ratio, which is also the transfer function squared in the absence of stochasticity. At the order of PT we work, this parametrization is equivalent to the results of effective field theory (EFT), and can thus be expanded in terms of the same parameters. We find that its radius of convergence is larger than the SPT loop expansion. The same EFT parametrization applies to all SPT loop terms and if stochasticity can be ignored, to all N-point correlators. In 3-d, the LPT structure is considerably more complicated, and we find that LPT models with parametrization motivated by the EFT exhibit running with k and that SPT is generally a better choice. Since these transfer function expansions contain free parameters that change with cosmological model their usefulness for broadband power is unclear. For this reason we test the predictions of these models on baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and other primordial oscillations, including string monodromy models, for which we ran a series of simulations with and without oscillations. Most models are successful in predicting oscillations beyond their corresponding PT versions, confirming the basic validity of the model. We show that if primordial oscillations are localized to a scale q, the wiggles in power spectrum are approximately suppressed as exp[−k2Σ2(q)/2], where Σ(q) is rms displacement of particles separated by q, which saturates on large scales, and decreases as q is reduced. No oscillatory features survive past k ∼ 0.5h/Mpc at z = 0.\n",

      " Title: A Hierarchy of Limitations in Machine Learning Abstract: \"All models are wrong, but some are useful\", wrote George E. P. Box (1979). Machine learning has focused on the usefulness of probability models for prediction in social systems, but is only now coming to grips with the ways in which these models are wrong---and the consequences of those shortcomings. This paper attempts a comprehensive, structured overview of the specific conceptual, procedural, and statistical limitations of models in machine learning when applied to society. Machine learning modelers themselves can use the described hierarchy to identify possible failure points and think through how to address them, and consumers of machine learning models can know what to question when confronted with the decision about if, where, and how to apply machine learning. The limitations go from commitments inherent in quantification itself, through to showing how unmodeled dependencies can lead to cross-validation being overly optimistic as a way of assessing model performance.\n",

Different formation channels produce different source distributions of total masses ${M_\\mathrm{tot}}$ and effective spins $\\chi_\\mathrm{eff}$ of coalescing binary BHs. Using a modified \\textsc{bse} code, we carry out extensive population synthesis calculations of the expected effective spin and total mass distributions from the standard field massive binary formation channel for different metallicities of BH progenitors (from zero-metal Population III stars up to solar metal abundance), different initial rotations of the binary components, stellar wind mass loss prescription, different BH formation models and a range of common envelope efficiencies. The stellar rotation is treated in two-zone (core-envelope) approximation using the effective core-envelope coupling time and with an account of the tidal synchronization of stellar envelope rotation during the binary system evolution. The results of our simulations, convolved with the metallicity-dependent star-formation history, show that the total masses and effective spins of the merging binary black holes detected during LIGO O1-O2 runs but the heaviest one (GW170729) can be simultaneously reproduced by the adopted BH formation models. Noticeable effective spin of GW170729 requires additional fallback from the rotating stellar envelope.\n",

      " Title: Matter bounce in Horava-Lifshitz cosmology Abstract: Horava-Lifshitz gravity, a recent proposal for a UV-complete renormalizable gravity theory, may lead to a bouncing cosmology. In this article we argue that Horava-Lifshitz cosmology may yield a concrete realization of the matter bounce scenario and thus give rise to an alternative to inflation for producing a scale-invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations. In this scenario, quantum vacuum fluctuations exit the Hubble radius in the prebounce phase, and the spectrum is transformed into a scale-invariant one on super-Hubble scales before the bounce because the long wavelength modes undergo squeezing of their wave functions for a longer period of time than shorter wavelength modes. The scale invariance of the spectrum of curvature fluctuations is preserved during and after the bounce. A distinctive prediction of this scenario is the amplitude and shape of the bispectrum.\n",

Here, we used first-principles calculations to investigate systematically their structural, electronic, and optical properties, analyzing the changes associated with the reduction of dimensionality, from bulk to monolayer or bilayer form. We show that all those binary phosphorene analogues are semiconducting, with band-gap energies covering part of the infrared and visible range, and in most cases higher than phosphorene. Further, we found that they have multiple valleys in the valence and conduction band, the latter with spin-orbit splitting of the order of 19--86 meV.\n",

      " Title: Pulsar Kicks and Spin Tilts in the Close Double Neutron Stars PSR J0737–3039, PSR B1534+12, and PSR B1913+16 Abstract: In view of the recent measurement of the scintillation velocity for PSR J0737-3039, we examine the complete set of constraints imposed on the pulsar B natal kicks (magnitude and orientation) and predict the most favorable pulsar kick velocity and spin tilt for both isotropic and polar kicks. Our analysis takes into account both currently unknown parameters: the orientation of the orbital plane on the sky (Ω) and the radial component of the systemic velocity (Vr). Assuming that the system's peculiar velocity is entirely due to the second supernova explosion, we find that the system may have crossed the Galactic plane multiple times since the birth of the second neutron star and that the postsupernova peculiar velocity could have been as high as ≃1200 km s-1. We also confirm the absolute lower and upper limits on the physical parameters derived in our earlier study. For specific combinations of the two unknown parameters Ω and Vr, however, we find much tighter constraints on the presupernova binary configuration and natal kicks imparted to pulsar B, as well as on the age of system. Once Ω is measured in the coming year, it will be straightforward to use the results presented here to further constrain the natal kicks and the spin-tilt predictions. We complete our comprehensive study and derive similar constraints and spin-tilt predictions for PSR B1534+12, for which the only free parameter is Vr. Finally, for PSR B1913+16 we update the progenitor and kick constraints using the measured pulsar spin tilt and allowing for Roche lobe overflow from the progenitor of the pulsar companion.\n",

      " Title: Microlensing Optical Depth and Event Rate toward the Galactic Bulge from 8 yr of OGLE-IV Observations Abstract: The number and properties of observed gravitational microlensing events depend on the distribution and kinematics of stars and other compact objects along the line of sight. In particular, precise measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Galactic bulge enable strict tests of competing models of the Milky Way. Previous estimates, based on samples of up to a few hundred events, gave larger values than expected from the Galactic models and were difficult to reconcile with other constraints on the Galactic structure. Here we used long-term photometric observations of the Galactic bulge by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to select a homogeneous sample of 8000 gravitational microlensing events. We created the largest and most accurate microlensing optical depth and event rate maps of the Galactic bulge. The new maps ease the tension between the previous measurements and Galactic models. They are consistent with some earlier calculations based on bright stars and are systematically ∼30% smaller than the other estimates based on “all-source” samples of microlensing events. The difference is caused by the careful estimation of the source star population. The new maps agree well with predictions based on the Besançon model of the Galaxy. Apart from testing the Milky Way models, our maps may have numerous other applications, such as the measurement of the initial mass function or constraining the dark matter content in the Milky Way center. The new maps will also inform the planning of future space-based microlensing experiments by revising the expected number of events.\n",

      " Title: Cavity State Manipulation Using Photon-Number Selective Phase Gates. Abstract: The large available Hilbert space and high coherence of cavity resonators make these systems an interesting resource for storing encoded quantum bits. To perform a quantum gate on this encoded information, however, complex nonlinear operations must be applied to the many levels of the oscillator simultaneously. In this work, we introduce the selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (snap) gate, which imparts a different phase to each Fock-state component using an off-resonantly coupled qubit. We show that the snap gate allows control over the quantum phases by correcting the unwanted phase evolution due to the Kerr effect. Furthermore, by combining the snap gate with oscillator displacements, we create a one-photon Fock state with high fidelity. Using just these two controls, one can construct arbitrary unitary operations, offering a scalable route to performing logical manipulations on oscillator-encoded qubits.\n",

      " Title: Contribution of primary carbonaceous aerosol to cloud condensation nuclei: processes and uncertainties evaluated with a global aerosol microphysics model Abstract: This paper explores the impacts of primary carbonaceous aerosol on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations in a global climate model with size-resolved aerosol microphysics. Organic matter (OM) and elemental carbon (EC) from two emissions inventories were incorporated into a preexisting model with sulfate and sea-salt aerosol. The addition of primary carbonaceous aerosol increased CCN(0.2%) concentrations by 65–90% in the globally averaged surface layer depending on the carbonaceous emissions inventory used. Sensitivity studies were performed to determine the relative importance of organic solubility/hygroscopicity in predicting CCN. In a sensitivity study where carbonaceous aerosol was assumed to be completely insoluble, concentrations of CCN(0.2%) still increased by 40–50% globally over the no carbonaceous simulation because primary carbonaceous emissions were able to become CCN via condensation of sulfuric acid. This shows that approximately half of the contribution of primary carbonaceous particles to CCN in our model comes from the addition of new particles (seeding effect) and half from the contribution of organic solute (solute effect). The solute effect tends to dominate more in areas where there is less inorganic aerosol than organic aerosol and the seeding effect tends to dominate in areas where there is more inorganic aerosol than organic aerosol. It was found that an accurate simulation of the number size distribution is necessary to predict the CCN concentration but assuming an average chemical composition will generally give a CCN concentration within a factor of 2. If a \"typical\" size distribution is assumed for each species when calculating CCN, such as is done in bulk aerosol models, the mean error relative to a simulation with size resolved microphysics is on the order of 35%. Predicted values of carbonaceous aerosol mass and aerosol number were compared to observations and the model showed average errors of a factor of 3 for carbonaceous mass and a factor of 4 for total aerosol number; however, errors in the accumulation mode concentrations were found to be lower in comparisons with European and marine observations.. The errors in CN and carbonaceous mass may be reduced by improving the emission size distributions of both primary sulfate and primary carbonaceous aerosol.\n",

      " Title: Phase correlations in cosmic microwave background temperature maps Abstract: We study the statistical properties of spherical harmonic modes of temperature maps of the cosmic microwave background. Unlike other studies, which focus mainly on properties of the amplitudes of these modes, we look instead at their phases. In particular, we present a simple measure of phase correlation that can be diagnostic of departures from the standard assumption that primordial density fluctuations constitute a statistically homogeneous and isotropic Gaussian random field, which should possess phases that are uniformly random on the unit circle. The method we discuss checks for the uniformity of the distribution of phase angles using a non-parametric descriptor based on the use of order statistics, which is known as Kuiper's statistic. The particular advantage of the method we present is that, when coupled to the judicious use of Monte Carlo simulations, it can deliver very interesting results from small data samples. In particular, it is useful for studying the properties of spherical harmonics at low l for which there are only a small number of independent values of m and which therefore furnish only a small number of phases for analysis. We apply the method to the COBE Differential Microwave Radiometer (DMR) and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) sky maps, and find departures from uniformity in both. In the case of WMAP, our results probably reflect Galactic contamination or the known variation of signal-to-noise ratio across the sky rather than primordial non-Gaussianity.\n",

      " Title: An Integrated Data Driven Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Gene-Disease Associations Abstract: Drug development is both increasing in cost whilst decreasing in productivity. There is a general acceptance that the current paradigm of R&D needs to change. One alternative approach is drug repositioning. With target-based approaches utilised heavily in the field of drug discovery, it becomes increasingly necessary to have a systematic method to rank gene-disease associations. Although methods already exist to collect, integrate and score these associations, they are often not a reliable reflection of expert knowledge. Furthermore, the amount of data available in all areas covered by bioinformatics is increasing dramatically year on year. It thus makes sense to move away from more generalised hypothesis driven approaches to research to one that allows data to generate their own hypothesis. We introduce an integrated, data driven approach to drug repositioning. We first apply a Bayesian statistics approach to rank 309,885 gene-disease associations using existing knowledge. Ranked associations are then integrated with other biological data to produce a semantically-rich drug discovery network. Using this network, we show how our approach identifies diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) to be an area of interest. CNS disorders are identified due to the low numbers of such disorders that currently have marketed treatments, in comparison to other therapeutic areas. We then systematically mine our network for semantic subgraphs that allow us to infer drug-disease relations that are not captured in the network. We identify and rank 275,934 drug-disease has_indication associations after filtering those that are more likely to be side effects, whilst commenting on the top ranked associations in more detail. The dataset has been created in Neo4j and is available for download at https://bitbucket.org/ncl-intbio/genediseaserepositioning along with a Java implementation of the searching algorithm.\n",

      " Title: Alternating Recurrent Dialog Model with Large-scale Pre-trained Language Models Abstract: Existing dialog system models require extensive human annotations and are difficult to generalize to different tasks. The recent success of large pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT-2 (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019) have suggested the effectiveness of incorporating language priors in down-stream NLP tasks. However, how much pre-trained language models can help dialog response generation is still under exploration. In this paper, we propose a simple, general, and effective framework: Alternating Recurrent Dialog Model (ARDM). ARDM models each speaker separately and takes advantage of the large pre-trained language model. It requires no supervision from human annotations such as belief states or dialog acts to achieve effective conversations. ARDM outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art methods on two popular task-oriented dialog datasets: CamRest676 and MultiWOZ. Moreover, we can generalize ARDM to more challenging, non-collaborative tasks such as persuasion. In persuasion tasks, ARDM is capable of generating human-like responses to persuade people to donate to a charity.\n",

      " Title: Stability selection enables robust learning of partial differential equations from limited noisy data Abstract: We present a statistical learning framework for robust identification of partial differential equations from noisy spatiotemporal data. Extending previous sparse regression approaches for inferring PDE models from simulated data, we address key issues that have thus far limited the application of these methods to noisy experimental data, namely their robustness against noise and the need for manual parameter tuning. We address both points by proposing a stability-based model selection scheme to determine the level of regularization required for reproducible recovery of the underlying PDE. This avoids manual parameter tuning and provides a principled way to improve the method's robustness against noise in the data. Our stability selection approach, termed PDE-STRIDE, can be combined with any sparsity-promoting penalized regression model and provides an interpretable criterion for model component importance. We show that in particular the combination of stability selection with the iterative hard-thresholding algorithm from compressed sensing provides a fast, parameter-free, and robust computational framework for PDE inference that outperforms previous algorithmic approaches with respect to recovery accuracy, amount of data required, and robustness to noise. We illustrate the performance of our approach on a wide range of noise-corrupted simulated benchmark problems, including 1D Burgers, 2D vorticity-transport, and 3D reaction-diffusion problems. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method on real-world data by considering a purely data-driven re-evaluation of the advective triggering hypothesis for an embryonic polarization system in C.~elegans. Using fluorescence microscopy images of C.~elegans zygotes as input data, our framework is able to recover the PDE model for the regulatory reaction-diffusion-flow network of the associated proteins.\n",

      " Title: The Predictive Accuracy of PREDICT: A Personalized Decision-Making Tool for Southeast Asian Women With Breast Cancer Abstract: Abstract Web-based prognostication tools may provide a simple and economically feasible option to aid prognostication and selection of chemotherapy in early breast cancers. We validated PREDICT, a free online breast cancer prognostication and treatment benefit tool, in a resource-limited setting. All 1480 patients who underwent complete surgical treatment for stages I to III breast cancer from 1998 to 2006 were identified from the prospective breast cancer registry of University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Calibration was evaluated by comparing the model-predicted overall survival (OS) with patients’ actual OS. Model discrimination was tested using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 50 years. The median tumor size at presentation was 3 cm and 54% of patients had lymph node-negative disease. About 55% of women had estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Overall, the model-predicted 5 and 10-year OS was 86.3% and 77.5%, respectively, whereas the observed 5 and 10-year OS was 87.6% (difference: −1.3%) and 74.2% (difference: 3.3%), respectively; P values for goodness-of-fit test were 0.18 and 0.12, respectively. The program was accurate in most subgroups of patients, but significantly overestimated survival in patients aged <40 years, and in those receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. PREDICT performed well in terms of discrimination; areas under ROC curve were 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74–0.81) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68–0.78) for 5 and 10-year OS, respectively. Based on its accurate performance in this study, PREDICT may be clinically useful in prognosticating women with breast cancer and personalizing breast cancer treatment in resource-limited settings.\n",

      " Title: XMM-NEWTON OBSERVATIONS OF A COMPLETE SAMPLE OF OPTICALLY SELECTED TYPE 2 SEYFERT GALAXIES Abstract: The majority of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) suffer from significant obscuration by surrounding dust and gas. The penetrating power and sensitivity of hard X-ray observations allow obscured AGNs to be probed out to high redshifts. However, X-ray surveys in the 2–10 keV band will miss the most heavily obscured AGNs in which the absorbing column density exceeds ∼1024 cm−2 (the Compton-thick AGN). It is, therefore, vital to know the fraction of AGNs that are missed in such X-ray surveys and to determine if these AGNs represent some distinct population in terms of the fundamental properties of AGNs and/or their host galaxies. In this paper, we present the analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray data for a complete sample of 17 low-redshift Type 2 Seyfert galaxies chosen from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey based solely on the high observed flux of the [O iii]λ5007 emission line. This line is formed in the narrow-line region hundreds of parsecs away from the central engine. Thus, unlike the X-ray emission, it is not affected by obscuration due to the torus surrounding the black hole. It therefore provides a useful isotropic indicator of the AGN luminosity. As additional indicators of the intrinsic AGN luminosity, we use the Spitzer Space Telescope to measure the luminosities of the mid-infrared continuum and the [O iv] 25.89 μm narrow emission line. We then use the ratio of the 2–10 keV X-ray luminosity to the [O iii], [O iv], and mid-infrared luminosities to assess the amount of X-ray obscuration and to distinguish between Compton-thick and Compton-thin objects. The various diagnostics of AGN luminosity with heavily obscured hard X-ray emission are in broad agreement. We find that the majority of the sources suffer significant amounts of obscuration: the observed 2–10 keV emission is depressed by more than an order of magnitude in 11 of the 17 cases (as expected for Compton-thick sources). Thus, surveys in the rest-frame 2–10 keV band will be significantly incomplete for obscured AGNs. We find a strong inverse correlation between the ratio of the 2–10 keV X-ray and [O iii] (or [O iv] or mid-IR) fluxes and the equivalent width of the 6.4 keV Fe Kα line. This demonstrates that the weak hard X-ray continuum emission is due to obscuration (rather than due to intrinsically weak emission). In several cases, the large amount of obscuration is not consistent with the values of absorbing column density derived from simple spectral fits to the data. We run simulations of a more physically realistic model with partial covering of the X-ray source plus Compton scattering, and show that such models are consistent with the data. We show that the distribution of obscuration in the 2–10 keV band in our sample is similar to what is seen in samples selected in the Swift BAT energy band (14–195 keV). This implies that the BAT surveys do recover a significant fraction of the local population of Compton-thick AGNs. Finally, we find no relationship between the amount of X-ray obscuration and the other properties of the AGN and its host galaxy. Hence, Compton-thick and Compton-thin sources do not seem to trace distinct populations.\n",

We present three higher dimensional scenarios how a runaway of the ``cosmological constant'' to zero can be combined with stable particle physics properties, leading at most to small variations of the ``fundamental couplings''.\n",

      " Title: Learning Actor Relation Graphs for Group Activity Recognition Abstract: Modeling relation between actors is important for recognizing group activity in a multi-person scene. This paper aims at learning discriminative relation between actors efficiently using deep models. To this end, we propose to build a flexible and efficient {\\rm Actor Relation Graph} (ARG) to simultaneously capture the appearance and position relation between actors. Thanks to the Graph Convolutional Network, the connections in ARG could be automatically learned from group activity videos in an end-to-end manner, and the inference on ARG could be efficiently performed with standard matrix operations. Furthermore, in practice, we come up with two variants to sparsify ARG for more effective modeling in videos: spatially localized ARG and temporal randomized ARG. We perform extensive experiments on two standard group activity recognition datasets: the Volleyball dataset and the Collective Activity dataset, where state-of-the-art performance is achieved on both datasets. We also visualize the learned actor graphs and relation features, which demonstrate that the proposed ARG is able to capture the discriminative relation information for group activity recognition.\n",
